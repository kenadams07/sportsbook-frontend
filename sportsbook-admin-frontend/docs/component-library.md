# Component Library Documentation

## Overview

This project follows a modular component architecture with a focus on reusability and consistency. All styling is centralized through a single index.css file with additional component-specific styles.

## Component Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/              # Base UI components
│   │   ├── Button.jsx   # Reusable button component
│   │   ├── Card.jsx     # Card container component
│   │   ├── Input.jsx    # Form input component
│   │   └── [styles]     # Corresponding CSS files
│   ├── Layout.jsx       # Main layout component
│   ├── Header.jsx       # Application header
│   └── [styles]         # Component-specific styles
```

## Styling Approach

### Global Styles
- All global styles are defined in `src/index.css`
- CSS variables are used for consistent theming
- Utility classes are available in `src/styles/globals.css`

### Component Styles
- Each component has its own CSS file
- Components inherit global styles but can override as needed
- CSS follows BEM naming conventions

## Authentication Flow

The application uses React Context for authentication state management:

1. `AuthContext` provides login/logout functionality
2. `useAuth` hook accesses authentication state
3. Protected routes are conditionally rendered based on auth state

## Responsive Design

All components are designed to be responsive:
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible grid layouts
- Media queries for different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interactions

## Best Practices

1. **Component Reusability**: Components should be generic and reusable
2. **Consistent Styling**: Use CSS variables for consistent colors, spacing, and typography
3. **Accessibility**: All components should follow accessibility guidelines
4. **Performance**: Lazy load components when possible
5. **Testing**: Write unit tests for complex components
